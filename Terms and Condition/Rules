    Any form of harassment, hate speech, or toxic behavior is strictly prohibited.

    Judges are expected to make their evaluations in good faith, based on criteria such as:
        Style of eliminations
        Use of abilities
        Tactical play and creativity
    The decisions of the judges are final, and no disputes regarding their judgment will be entertained.

3. Voting and Performance Rating

    Votes or ratings given by judges (dead players) may impact the overall outcome of the game or award style points.
    Judges are required to submit their votes within the allocated time to ensure smooth gameplay.
    Manipulation of the voting process or collaboration to unfairly boost a player’s score is not permitted.

4. Hero and Skin Rules

    Players are encouraged to use their most creative hero skins to fit the "Dress to Impress" theme.

    Hero switching during the match is allowed unless otherwise specified by the host.

5. Camera and Cinematic Rules

    Custom camera angles and movements may be used to simulate cinematic shots during gameplay. Players agree to have their gameplay showcased in these shots.
    These shots may focus on key moments such as eliminations, use of ultimate abilities, or multi-kills to enhance the gameplay experience.
    Players agree that these camera angles may also be used to aid in judging their performance.

6. Cheating and Exploits

    Exploiting bugs, glitches, or using cheats is strictly prohibited and will result in immediate removal from the game.
    Any attempts to disrupt the fairness of the game through illegal means will be met with disciplinary action.
